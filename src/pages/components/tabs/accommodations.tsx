    <div>The castle is situated in the rustic Tuscan countryside. What were originally farmhouses serving the vineyards and the estate have now been fully renovated into villas and apartments.</div>
    <div>
      During our stay, our wedding party will have the entire property for exclusive use, meaning that we will be the only ones staying in the villas and apartments, each of which has a living room and kitchen. The villas include larger common areas, which can be enjoyed by any guests regardless of where they are staying. There are also three pools for shared use on the property.  
    </div>
    <div>
      We will be arranging the rooming assignments ourselves, placing groups of friends and groups of family together. Even with our modest guest list, we are filling all available living quarters on the property, so single guests should be prepared for double occupancy rooms. If you have specific questions about your accommodations, feel free to reach out to us directly.
