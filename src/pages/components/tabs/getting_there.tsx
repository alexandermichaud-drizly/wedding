      Regardless of your travel plans, contact us when you have determined when
      and how you&apos;ll arrive. We can help you arrange transportation
      that&apos;s offered by the venue. The most convenient point of entry will
      be the Florence airport (FLO). You will almost certainly have to stop over
      in a larger European city on the way. If you are travelling in Italy
      beforehand, you might also consider arriving by train. We are also able to
      arrange transportation from the Santa Maria Novella station.

      The castle is approximately a half hour drive from Florence.
      Transportation arranged through us will be able drop you off at the door
      of your villa. We do not recommend arranging a private taxi or uber to the
      castle. They will be more expensive and will not be able to take you
      directly to the villa in which you are staying. Let us save you the
      trouble of bringing your bags up the hill!
