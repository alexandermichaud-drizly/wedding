      Regardless of your travel plans, contact us when you have determined when
      and how you&apos;ll arrive. We can help you arrange transportation
      that&apos;s offered by the venue. The most convenient point of entry will
      be the Florence Airport, Peretola (FLR). You might also consider flying
      into Pisa (PSA) or Bologna (BLQ), from which we can also arrange a
      pick-up. In any case, you will almost certainly have to stop over in a
      larger European city on the way.

      Another option would be to fly into Rome (FCO) and take a train to
      Florence. Many European budget airlines fly to Rome, the trains to
      Florence are affordable, and the castle can pick you up from Santa Maria
      Novella station. Trains in Italy are generally affordable, so you might
      also consider arriving by train if you are traveling in Italy beforehand.
      If you have rented a car, there is free parking on-site at the venue.

      The castle is approximately a half hour drive from Florence.
      Transportation arranged through us will be able drop you off at the door
      of your villa. We do not recommend arranging a private taxi or uber to the
      castle. They will be more expensive and will not be able to take you
      directly to the villa in which you are staying. Let us save you the
      trouble of bringing your bags up the hill!
