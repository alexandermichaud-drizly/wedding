        Italian meals are large, so two per day will be enough for most. If you
        anticipate that you would like additional meals, see below for more food
        / dining options. PLEASE NOTE: The wedding dinner is a multi-course,
        traditional Italian feast with generous portions. We know because we
        tried it ourselves. We strongly recommend you save your appetite on the
        wedding day.

            Every villa or apartment has at least one fully equipped kitchen
            (including stove, oven, microwave, fridge, freezer, and coffee
            maker). Kitchens will be stocked with some snacks and coffee.
          </div>
          <div>
            There are also grocery stores a short driving distance (see details
            in a question below) where additional groceries can be bought. There
            will be daily grocery runs for which you’ll also be able to put in
            requests.

          Although there is a restaurant on-site, it only opens for special
          events. If you are interested in freshly made, hot takeout food from
          the restaurant please contact us to order it at least 2 months before
          the wedding date; please specify for which days and times you would
          like the order to be available. Takeout options include:

    question: 'What drinks are included?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        Wine is included with the welcome dinner, the pizza dinner, and the
        wedding feast. There will also be cocktails with the wedding aperitivo,
        and an open bar during the wedding party.

    question: 'Where can I purchase more to drink?',
    answer: (

        <div>
          All wine consumed on the premises must be purchased through the
          Castle. The Castle wine shop sells wines they produce on-site, as well
          as bottles from other wineries across Italy. In our humble opinion,
          the wines are consistently of stellar quality. Prices start at $10 EUR
          a bottle.
        </div>
        <div>
          Spirits, beer, and all types of alcohol besides wine can be brought in
          and consumed around the property without restriction.

    question:
      'What are the surfaces at and around the Castle like? What shoes should I wear?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        The path in between the villas/ apartments and the main restaurant and
        Castle (where the wedding ceremony will be held) is not paved, but on
        gravel or grass, so please bring comfortable shoes! For the wedding
        night, for women planning on wearing heels, we’d recommend considering
        wedges (given the aperitivo will be at a courtyard, on grass).

  {
    question: 'What other clothing should I bring?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        Swimsuits! And active wear if you want to take advantage of the outdoor
        activities. There are three pools, walking and hiking trails, bikes,
        etc., so make sure to bring some comfortable clothes in addition to the
        wedding attire!

          Castle grounds, such as horseback riding and vineyard tours, that
